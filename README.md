# BoundaryLayers
Different codes related to boundary layer method. Mostly as educational tools.

Most of the problems are from Mark Holmes' book "Introduction to perturbation methods". For some of the problems, 
there are exact solutions, with which I have tried to compare the results from perturbation methods. Maybe at a later
stage, I will add numerical results for problems which have no exact analytical solutions.
